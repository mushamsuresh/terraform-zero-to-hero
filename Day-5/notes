Generated keypair using windows powershell command
 ```powershell ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f "C:\Users\sures\OneDrive\Desktop\Devops notes\terrafom practice\SSH key_pair\my_terraform_key" ```
This will create public and private key. For private key it is not mandatory to have .pem extension.
Now replace the path in connections private_key path to the path that the file is downloaded in the local machine.
In key_pair resource we mention the path of the public key.
Note:  public key is uploaded during the instance creation by providing the path or manually pasting the text
       private key path is mentioned only in connection resource. So that terraform gets connected to ec2 instance
As we are uploading python file using file provisioner command we need private key and file get uploaded to instance.
by default ec2 instance is installed with python, no need to install it again . so in remote exec block we did not mention any code or commands to install the python.
NOw that insatnce is created, key pair and python file is uploaded. To check the files from local machine use below commands.
run this command ssh -i "C:\Users\sures\OneDrive\Desktop\Devops notes\terrafom practice\SSH key_pair\my_terraform_key" ec2-user@<PUBLIC_IP>
Now the local manchine is connected to the aws instance. check the file using "ls" command. To run the code use cat command.
